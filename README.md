## Agile Developement Methodology 

Agile methodology, rooted in the Agile Manifesto, transforms product development by prioritizing incremental delivery, frequent customer feedback, and adaptability. It addresses the shortcomings of traditional waterfall approaches by breaking projects into smaller, manageable iterations called sprints, fostering quicker response to evolving requirements. Agile extends its applicability beyond software development to various industries, emphasizing responsiveness to market needs and customer demands. It encompasses methods like Scrum, XP, and Kanban, along with technical practices like DevOps, facilitating efficient delivery processes. The Agile Manifesto, established in 2001, articulates core values and principles for software development, serving as a guiding beacon for agile practitioners worldwide.

### 12 Agile Manifesto Principles:

* Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Embrace changing requirements for the customer's competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, preferably in shorter timescales.
* Daily collaboration between businesspeople and developers.
* Build projects around motivated individuals, providing them with the necessary support.
* Face-to-face conversation is the most efficient way to convey information within a team.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Promote sustainable development for long-term success.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity is crucial; maximize work not done.
* Self-organizing teams produce the best architectures, requirements, and designs.
* Regular reflection and adaptation to improve effectiveness.

### Popular Agile Methodologies:
* Scrum
* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Adaptive Software Development (ASD)
* Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM)
* Feature Driven Development (FDD)
* Kanban
* Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

This project was developed using Github Kanbanboard Click on the link to access-> [here](https://github.com/users/FerchaPombo/projects/1) .


Kanban is an Agile management method built on a philosophy of continuous improvement, where work items are “pulled” from a product backlog into a steady flow of work. The framework is applied using Kanban boards, a form of visual project management. In a Kanban board, tasks—represented as cards—move through stages of work—represented as columns. That way, your team can see where work is in real-time.

Kanban is especially popular with product, engineering, and software development teams. But any team that wants to create a more dynamic, flexible workflow can use them.

Kanban teams use a visualization tool called Kanban boards to manage their workload and flow.

In a Kanban board, work is displayed on a project board that is organized by columns. Traditionally, each column represents a stage of work. The most basic Kanban board might have columns like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.” Each column is filled with visual cards that represent individual tasks. A team moves through the columns until the tasks are completed.

![MY Kanban board](/static/images/Kanbanboard.png)

Kanban boards visually represent a team's tasks using cards or sticky notes arranged in columns on a whiteboard. Swimlanes within the columns illustrate the value stream, representing stages tasks must pass through. Cards are placed in the appropriate swimlane to map out the workflow.

As work advances, team members shift cards from left to right. Some swimlanes may have a WIP limit to maintain the system's efficiency.


### User Stories 

This section is dedicated to defining user expectations when interacting with the website. Utilizing the agile methodology and leveraging the GitHub Issues Kanban board, I have crafted user stories categorized into two main groups: site users and user admins. Each user type's actions and scenarios are documented comprehensively in this section.

## UX Design 

### Ux principles 
User Experience (UX) design is a process focused on creating products that offer meaningful and relevant experiences to users. It involves various elements, including branding, design, usability, and functionality, aiming to address users' pain points and needs throughout their journey with the product. While designers cannot control users' perceptions and responses, they can influence how the product behaves and looks.

UX design is user-centered and multidisciplinary, drawing from backgrounds such as visual design, programming, psychology, and interaction design. Designers conduct tasks like user research, creating personas, designing wireframes and prototypes, and testing designs.

### Wireframes 

The site's wireframes were crafted using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) software, covering desktop, tablet, and mobile interfaces. While the text content wasn't finalized at that stage, it's important to note some visual variances from the wireframes due to design decisions made during development.

### Site Structure 

The Findit Berlin website is designed with a clear division for users based on their login status.
Whether logged in or out, distinct pages cater to their needs. When logged out, users can only access pages such as 'About,' 'home,' 'Search,' and 'Post Details' 
Upon logging in, additional features including 'Posting,' 'Commenting’, ‘Adding Bookmarks,' and 'Creating a  Profile' become available, enhancing the user experience. 
Further insights into these choices in the 'Features' section.

## Design Choices 

### Color Scheme:

The design of the Findit BERLIN site draws inspiration from the Bootstrap 'light' color theme, fostering a visually appealing environment. Complemented by the subtle accents of Bootstrap Blue for the links, the site achieves a harmonious balance between aesthetics and functionality. Embracing a clean, easy-to-navigate, and minimalistic approach, users are greeted with a seamless browsing experience that enhances their exploration of the platform.


### Typography 

The Inter Font was chosen for its simple yet elegant design and its excellent readability. This font was obtained at no cost from Google Fonts, ensuring accessibility and compatibility with the project's design goals.

![About](/static/images/about.png)

#### Landing Maing Page

On the landing page, users, whether logged in or not, can easily access the blog's list of posts. The layout is simple and intuitive, with pagination allowing users to navigate through the blog's content, organized in sets of six posts per page. Each post is displayed as a card, featuring a clickable link to view the post's details. Additionally, users can see the author of each post and the number of likes it has garnered, providing valuable context and engagement opportunities.

The addition of the jumbotron function serves to captivate and engage new users upon landing, guiding them seamlessly through a user-friendly registration process. Additionally, it provides a concise introduction to the concept of the blog, setting the stage for their exploration.

Home
![Home](/static/images/Home.png)

#### Users Dashboard


In the user dashboard, each user, including the admin, is greeted with a personalized view showcasing a list of posts they've created. Here, users have the ability to perform actions such as editing or deleting their posts. Each action is accompanied by a warning prompt, ensuring users are informed before proceeding, and a confirmation message informs them of the success or failure of their action.

The admin enjoys exclusive privileges, including the ability to approve, delete, or manage comments across all users' posts. This ensures that the platform maintains high standards of content quality and moderation.

Additionally, users can create new posts directly from the dashboard. If the admin is logged in, posts are instantly published without the need for approval. However, for regular users, a message notifies them that their post is awaiting approval, ensuring transparency and adherence to the platform's guidelines.

Post Detail 
![Users Dashboard](/static/images/usersdashboard.png)
![Users Dashboard 2](/static/images/usersdashboard2.png)

#### Footer

The footer is minimally designed to feature a simple text acknowledging the blog's creator and providing links to social media platforms. Positioned at the bottom of the page, it seamlessly blends with the background color of the blog, ensuring it remains unobtrusive and complementary to the overall design. As the blog does not offer any services requiring contact forms, the footer serves as a subtle yet informative addition to the site.

![Footer](/static/images/footer.png)

#### Admin Panel 

The full admin panel functionality is currently accessible exclusively through Django /admin. That said,  when the admin is logged in, the user dashboard offers special privileges tailored specifically for administrative tasks. For instance, there's no need for post or comment approval, and the admin can edit or delete posts and comments as needed. Additionally, the admin has the authority to erase comments made by users, ensuring the safety and integrity of the site.

#### Registration 

New visitors to Findit Berlin who don't have a registered account can sign up here.

![Register](/static/images/Register.png)

#### Login 

This page allows users to log in to their Findit Berlin account to access their personalized content and special features.

![Log In](/static/images/login.png)

#### Logout 

Clicking "Logout" in the menu bar prompts a confirmation page to prevent accidental sign-outs.

![Logout](/static/images/logout.png)

#### Profile 

Users can create a brief and straightforward profile. The primary focus of this page is not to serve as a social networking platform but rather as a blog for discovering new city spots shared by others. Consequently, the profile contains minimal personal information. It is showcased on the post details page, allowing users to identify the author and access their profile via a link.

Logged-in users can navigate to their profile on a dedicated page, where they have the option to edit their profile if necessary. The profile includes their name, a brief bio, and links to their social media profiles.


As indicated in the unresolved issues section, there's a current issue with displaying user-uploaded profile pictures. Whether uploaded via the admin panel or the site's edit form, profile images are not rendering properly and are only showing as placeholders.

![Profile dropdown ](/static/images/Profiledropdown.png)
![Profile Page Placeholder](/static/images/profilepageplaceholder.png)


### Features Left to implement 

* In the future, the blog will evolve to include the exciting feature of geolocation tagging for each post. This enhancement will enable users to capture and share photos of street art, accompanied by the specific location of each piece. This way, others can easily visit and appreciate the artwork firsthand.

* Additionally, a Category section will be implemented, organized by neighborhoods. Users will have the option to browse posts related to a particular neighborhood of interest, facilitating exploration and discovery of street art within specific areas of the city.

* The validation of the individual 'style.css' file passed the validator with no issues or warnings. 
![W3C](/static/images/W3Cpassed.png)


* When the JavaScript code was validated using the [JSHint validator](https://jshint.com/), no errors were reported in the console. However, it's important to note that the cleanup of unused variables will be conducted after the project is deployed and submitted.

    * Here are the results of the analysis:

        * The file contains 4 functions.
        * The largest function consists of 13 statements.
        * The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 5, while the median complexity is 2.
        * The function with the largest signature takes 1 argument, and the median signature takes 1 argument as well.
        * Additionally, the analysis revealed:

        * One undefined variable: bootstrap
        * Three unused variables: editModal, editCommentForm, and getCookie

#### Python Validation 

Python code was validated with the Code Institute [Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/). Subsequently, I tested the following Python files with some minor spaceing mentions: 

* blog/admin.py - Passed with no errors or warnings reported 
* blog/forms.py - Passed with no errors reported 
* blog/models.py - No errors or warnings reported
* blog/urls.py - No errors or warnings reported
* blog/views.py - No errors or warnings reported


#### Lighthouse Testing 

Lighthouse, available within Chrome Developer Tools, served as the testing tool for various aspects of the application, including Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. 
Testing was conducted on the index page, and details page, yielding the following results:

* Index Page: Performance: 88, Accessibility: 983, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 90

* Review Details Page: Performance: 95, Accessibility: 87, Best Practices: 96, SEO: 90

100 % could be easily achived with a little bit more time to work on the detials.

### Responsiveness Test


The responsiveness of Findit Berlin was thoroughly tested using [Developer Tools]() and the [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) webpage, successfully passing all tests. This ensures that the website is optimized for various screen sizes and devices, providing users with a consistent and enjoyable experience across different platforms.

### Browser Compatibility

* Safari Version 17.2.1 (17617.1.17.11.12, 17617): The site experienced a minor change in the expansion of the container but maintained responsiveness and overall design.
* Google Chrome Version 122.0.6261.129 (Official Build) (x86_64): Tested on desktop with no reported issues.
* Google Chrome Version 123.0.6312.80: Tested on Android 10; CLT-L29 Build/HUAWEICLT-L29 without any observed changes.
* Mozilla Firefox Version 124.0.2: Tested on desktop without encountering any issues.


## Bugs

### Bugs to Fix 

* When the code was passes through thepassed the [Nu Html checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) the following errors appeared: 
    * Styling properties embeded in the HTML file. This issue appeard right after submission time, and due to lack of time, i decided to leave the working Css properties on the html file. 
![NuHMTL](/static/images/hmtlvalidatorfinal.png)


* Several bugs and tasks remain to be addressed, primarily focusing on testing and functionality enhancements. Notably, testing of Python code has not been conducted, and while the Pep8 tool was unavailable, no further tests were performed to ensure the reliability of the codebase.

* One crucial task is to implement a "Delete" button for administrators to remove posts directly from the site interface, eliminating the need to navigate to the Django admin panel.

* Additionally, users should be able to create and edit their profiles, with the ability to view their profile displayed on a separate page and in the detail page of each post they create. Currently, only a placeholder image is displayed, and uploaded images from profiles or the admin site are not rendered on the website. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure proper functionality and user experience.

## Acknowledgements 

Findit Berlin is a fictional website developed for the Portfolio Project #4 at the Code Institute. During the project, I encountered significant challenges and relied heavily on external support. I am deeply grateful to Michelle, a dear friend, who generously offered her time and expertise. Michelle assisted me in resolving compatibility issues and dependencies at the project's outset, enabling me to overcome initial hurdles. Despite working with a deprecated module, I persevered for over a month and a half in attempting to integrate geolocation functionality with older library versions. Michelle's guidance and support were instrumental in restoring functionality to my project. Additionally, during a second meeting, she provided valuable insights that helped streamline the arrangement of Modals and Views for the final editing functionality.

I am also thankful to my tutor and fellow alumni in the Slack community, who provided invaluable support during moments of frustration and despair, reminding me that there is always a solution to every challenge. Through collaborative efforts and mentorship, I was able to navigate through obstacles and ultimately achieve project success.
